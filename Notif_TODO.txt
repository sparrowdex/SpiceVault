Step 1: Identify User Actions and Events to Track
Liking a recipe

Saving a recipe

Rating a recipe

Viewing a recipe (especially from others)

Ranking of recipes (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time top 5)

Comments on recipes

Replies from chefs to user reviews

Step 2: Define Notification Types and Target Users
Notifications for users when their recipe is liked, saved, rated, or viewed

Notifications when recipes rank in the top 5 (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time)

Notifications when someone comments on a recipe (especially if user is a chef)

Notifications to users when a chef replies to their review

Step 3: Notification Data Structure
Store notification details like type, associated recipe ID, user IDs involved, timestamps, read/unread status

Step 4: Backend Event Handling
Integrate triggers in the backend to create notifications on relevant events (like, save, rate, comment, rank update)

Step 5: Notification Storage
Use a database or message queue to store and manage notifications per user

Step 6: Frontend Notification Panel UI
Implement a notification panel with a bell icon in navbar

Display list of notifications relevant to the logged-in user

Support opening/closing the panel and marking notifications as read

Step 7: Real-time Updates (Optional)
Integrate websockets or polling to update notifications live when new events occur

Step 8: Permissions and Filtering
Ensure proper notification visibility — e.g., only chefs see comments on their recipes, users get notified about chef replies to their reviews

Step 9: Ranking Updates
Schedule periodic backend jobs to calculate and update recipe rankings and notify chefs accordingly

Step 10: Testing and User Feedback
Test each notification type across user roles

Collect user feedback to adjust notification thresholds or content
