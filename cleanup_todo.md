# TODO List

- Create a separate leaderboard page for chef accounts to display popular recipes by chefs.
- Implement a user account feature for "chef certified recipes" which includes:
  - A slideshow of images from chef-added recipes.
  - Display the rest of the recipes added by the chef below the slideshow with their names.
- Add user rating system to the full recipe page (current priority).
- Further tweak and enhance the chef certified recipes feature based on feedback.
